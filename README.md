Vacant Homes - Frontend for the the web


## Getting Started
The website requires a http server for the file reading to work.
Please note that if you try to open directly from the file, Chrome will return an error that only HTTP, HTTPS protocols are allowed to read from the file. 
On my local machine you will need to run the code on the local server 

One possible option: 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
 
To install it, please use node.js and the command below
`npm install http-server -g`

Then run the following command to start the server in your current directory (where the repository is stored)
`http-server`

You will be able to open the website in the browser using the following URL:
`http://localhost:8080/`
